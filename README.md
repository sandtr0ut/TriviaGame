> A real test of your Star Wars fan-hood. These questions are not for the faint of heart! This particular version delves deeply into the many wonderful books of the "expanded universe" (non-canon). The movies won't help you here. This is trivia at its nerdiest and, therefore, most awesome.

> Try your hand at it and see what happens. Please submit suggestions for future questions or feature upgrades.
